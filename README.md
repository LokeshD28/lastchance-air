# ✈️ LastChance Air  
Smart Last-Minute Flight Deals Platform  

## 📌 Overview
LastChance Air is a full-stack web application designed to surface discounted last-minute domestic U.S. flight deals (3–7 days before departure).

Airlines often operate flights with empty seats close to departure, resulting in lost revenue. This platform simulates dynamic airline pricing logic to help travelers quickly find urgent travel deals while optimizing seat utilization.

- 15–20% of domestic flights depart with empty seats.
- Travelers struggle to find affordable last-minute flights.
